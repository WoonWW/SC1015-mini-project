# As there is an increase in the COE prices in Singapore, owning a car is very costly.
# We do not want to waste too much money in buying a car so we seek to understand which factors affect the selling prices of a car and to what extent.
# Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/athirags/car-data
# We remove those cars with 3 previous owners and uses compressed natural gas (CNG) as their fuel type as we only want to consider cars with at most 1 previous driver and CNG is not readily available in Singapore.
# We also changed some categorical variables to numerical data so that we can include them in our regression model.
# The machine learning technique we are using is linear regression to check which factors affect selling price the most.
# We have concluded that kilometers driven by the car does not affect the price much, while the year the car was sold and the present price of the car affected the selling price of the car positively. We can also conclude that manual cars and petrol cars are much cheaper compared to the automatic ones and diesel cars.
